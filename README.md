The ultimate aim of this work is to develop a prototype platform for detecting, tracking, and classifying (DTC) fully context-based social data. The platform is envisioned to provide a unified, multi-domain sensor-based API for a social regulation framework, which integrates sensor inputs into social primitives using specially refined and filtered data streams with both integrated and specialized neural networks across text, image and audio domains. In phase one, real-time DTC is expected for the hardware, while real-time integration will follow in a second phase and maturation of an appropriate training dataset.

In particular, a catalog of unique facial identities will be constructed, following some elementary post-processing (gain normalization, etc), from a linear synthetic discriminant applied to optical input. Use of a uniform planar microwave array is envisioned for motion detection, which aids time-series identity management -- both alerting process managers to initiate finer optical-based facial recognition and aiding optical tracking algorithms for moving-target processing. Parallel infrared processing on regions with active identities will aid the optical data for purposes of generating a classification of emotional states for the identity. Likewise, acoustic data from a beamsteered uniform circular and uniform planar acoustic array may be integrated with the optical and infrared data for acquiring an acoustic signal that identifies unique (via multi-focal beamsteering) vocal utterances, along with, perhaps, facilities for validating and verifying the acoustic signature for purposes of identity management. Angle-of-arrival capabilities in the uniform cicruclar array will also aid in scheduling based on the detection of certain acoustic signals. Spatial awareness is gathered from an inertial sensor.

Once all of the relevant social primitives have been constructed for all signals from a given context, the platform will have established a condition of social awareness for a small time interval described by a collection of human identities, emotional states, utterances, and body language symbols. This data is to be integrated with some (possibly large) collection of historical moments using cross-domain neural networks for purposes of generating socially relevant responses to the moment.
